= XDG 0.5

  http://xdg.rubyforge.org

XDG provides a module for supporting the XDG Base Directory
Standard[1].

If your program utilizes user or system-wide support files
(eg. configuration files), you owe it to yourself to checkout
the XDG standard.

In this release, _glob methods were renamed to _select and now
can take a selection block in addition to, or as opposed to,
the glob pattern argument.

What's next? The API should be stable now. I do not forsee
and reasons for it to change. In the future, I may add some
additonal ruby-esque features, but that should be purely
in addition to what is already there. If all this holds true
for a hwile a 1.0 release will be forth-coming.
