XDG 0.4 hits the streets!

  http://xdg.rubyforge.org

This release removes the xdg_ prefix from the instance-level
method names. Now module and instance levels are the same.

Also, data_file, config_file and cache_file have been replaced with
data_find, config_find, config_glob and data_find, cache_find,
cache_glob respectively.

What' next? Well, I can't say I'm fond of the term 'glob', so I
may rename that to 'map' or 'collect' (or 'select'?)  and then 
add the ability to use blocks for matching too.

### 0.4.0 / 2008-10-26

* Renamed instance level methods without 'xdg_' prefix.
* Replace _file methods with _find and _glob methods.
