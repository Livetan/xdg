This release removes the xdg_ prefix from the instance-level
method names. Now module and instance levels are the same.

Also, config_file and cach_file have been replaced with
config_find, config_glob and cache_find, cache_glob respectively.

### 0.4.0 / 2008-10-26

* Renamed instance level methods without 'xdg_' prefix.
* Replace _file methods with _find and _glob methods.
