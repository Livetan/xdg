= XDG Base Directory Standards for Ruby

  http://xdg.rubyforge.org

== Introduction

XDG provides an easy to use module for utilizing
the XDG Base Directory Standard[1].

If your program utilizes user or system-wide support files
(eg. configuration files), you owe it to yourself to checkout
the XDG standard.

In this release, _glob methods were renamed to _select and now
can take a selection block in addition to, or as opposed to,
the glob pattern argument.

What's next? The API should be stable now. I do not forsee
and reasons for it to change. In the future, I may add some
additonal ruby-esque features, but that should be purely
in addition to what is already there. If all this holds true
for a hwile a 1.0 release will be forth-coming.

== Release Notes

Please see the RELEASE file.

== Usage

XDG is a module with a small set of easy to use methods:

  XDG.config_home
  XDG.config_dirs
  XDG.config_find(pattern){ |path| ... }
  XDG.config_select(pattern){ |path| ... }

  XDG.data_home
  XDG.data_dirs
  XDG.data_find(pattern){ |path| ... }
  XDG.data_select(pattern){ |path| ... }

  XDG.cache_home
  XDG.cache_find(pattern){ |path| ... }
  XDG.cache_select(pattern){ |path| ... }

  XDG.config_work
  XDG.data_work
  XDG.cache_work

If you know XDG these are pretty much self-explanitory.
But see the RDocs for specifics.
